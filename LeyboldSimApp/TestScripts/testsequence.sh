# NB - there is an issue here.
# This script previously invoked ../../LeyboldTurboApp/Scripts/Reset.py and ../../LeyboldTurboApp/Scripts/SetRunning.py.
# However, each caput/caget causes warnings due to multiple IP nodes - IP V4. IP V6 and localhost, that have the same PV.
# (The fact that these are one and the same is not taken in to account.)
# When there are too many warnings, the (pytyhon) script fails with errors:
# "sys.excepthook is missing".
